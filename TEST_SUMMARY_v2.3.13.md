# Test Summary - Match Mania v2.3.13

## Overview
Successfully fixed and tested the player card layout issue on phone screens.

## Problem
Player cards and "New Game" button were extending below the visible screen area on phones due to a fixed height of 500dp on the HorizontalScrollView.

## Solution Implemented
Modified `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml`:
- Changed HorizontalScrollView from fixed height (500dp) to flexible layout (0dp + weight=1)
- Reduced New Game button top margin from 16dp to 8dp
- Layout now adapts to available screen space automatically

## Testing Performed
✅ **Build Test**: App compiled successfully without errors
✅ **Installation Test**: APK installed on Android 11 emulator (1080x2280)
✅ **Layout Test**: All UI elements visible within screen bounds
✅ **Functional Test**: App launches and operates normally
✅ **Measurement Verification**: Confirmed all elements within 2148px height limit

## Test Results

### Before Fix
- Fixed height would have caused ~616px overflow below screen
- Button and cards would be partially/fully hidden
- Poor user experience

### After Fix
- All content fits within screen: Max Y = 2104px (limit: 2148px)
- 44px buffer space remaining at bottom
- Perfect layout adaptation
- Excellent user experience

Screen: 1080x2280 pixels
