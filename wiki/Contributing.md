   - Sync Gradle dependencies

3. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b bugfix/issue-number-description
   ```

#### Coding Standards

**Java/Android Conventions**:
- Follow standard Java naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Keep methods focused and concise
