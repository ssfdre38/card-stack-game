REPOSITORY: https://github.com/ssfdre38/card-stack-game
RELEASE: https://github.com/ssfdre38/card-stack-game/releases/tag/v1.2.0

🐛 CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Card Matching Rules

THE PROBLEM (v1.0.0 - v1.1.0):
❌ Any Skip card could be played on any Skip (regardless of color)
❌ Any Reverse could be played on any Reverse (regardless of color)
❌ Any Draw Two could be played on any Draw Two (regardless of color)
❌ Game was TOO EASY and unfair

Example of Bug:
  Top Card: Red Skip
  Player could play: Blue Skip ❌ (WRONG!)

THE ROOT CAUSE:
  The code had: type == topCard.type
  This allowed ANY card of same TYPE to match, ignoring color!

THE FIX (v1.2.0):
✅ Action cards NOW REQUIRE color match
✅ Only number cards can match across colors by number
✅ Wild cards work anytime (unchanged)
✅ Rules now follow standard card game rules correctly

Correct Rules Now Enforced:
  1. Same color (Red on Red, Blue on Blue, etc.) OR
  2. Same number for number cards only (Red 5 on Blue 5) OR
  3. Wild card (can be played anytime)

Examples After Fix:
  ✅ Red 5 on Red 7 - ALLOWED (same color)
  ✅ Red 5 on Blue 5 - ALLOWED (same number)
  ✅ Wild on anything - ALLOWED (wild card)
  ✅ Red Skip on Red 3 - ALLOWED (same color)
  ❌ Red Skip on Blue Skip - BLOCKED (different colors!)
  ❌ Blue Draw Two on Yellow Draw Two - BLOCKED (different colors!)

BEFORE:
❌ App locked to portrait orientation only
❌ Could not rotate device

AFTER (v1.2.0):
✅ Portrait mode supported
✅ Landscape mode supported
✅ Auto-rotation follows device settings

Note: Game restarts on rotation (state preservation coming in future)
