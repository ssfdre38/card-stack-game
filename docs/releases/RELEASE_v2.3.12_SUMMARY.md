# Match Mania v2.3.12 - Release Summary

## 🎉 Perfect Tablet Card Display!

**Release Date:** January 5, 2025  
**Version:** 2.3.12 (versionCode: 30)  
**Status:** ✅ Successfully Released & Deployed

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### The Problem (User Report)
> "card draw is still not correct on the tablet and is still narrow for the player cards"
> "its not the width, its the hight of the player cards draw that is having issues"

**Both dimensions were wrong!**
- Cards too NARROW (180dp width)
- Cards too SQUISHED (no height guarantee)

### The Solution (v2.3.12)

**Two-Part Fix:**

1. **Card Width (MainActivity.java)**
   - Increased max width: 180dp → **240dp** (+33% wider!)
   - Reduced divider: 3 → **2** (fewer but wider cards)
   - Result: Shows 2-3 wide cards using ~40% of screen each

2. **Card Height (activity_main.xml)**
   - Added: **minHeight="400dp"** to player card container
   - Result: Guarantees 360dp card height + margins
   - Cards never squished vertically anymore!
