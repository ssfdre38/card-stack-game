# Emulator Test Report - v2.3.13

## Test Date
October 5, 2025

## Test Device
- **Emulator**: Android Emulator (test_device)
- **Android Version**: Android 11 (API 30)
- **Screen Size**: 1080x2280 pixels
- **Screen Density**: ~440 dpi
- **Architecture**: x86_64

## Test Objective
Verify that the player card layout fix resolves the issue where player cards and the "New Game" button were extending below the visible screen area on phones.

## Issue Description (Before Fix)
The `HorizontalScrollView` containing player cards had a fixed height of 500dp, which caused:
- Player cards area extending beyond screen boundaries
- "New Game" button partially or completely hidden
- Poor user experience on phone-sized screens

## Fix Applied
Changed `HorizontalScrollView` in `activity_main.xml`:
- **From**: `android:layout_height="500dp"`
- **To**: `android:layout_height="0dp"` with `android:layout_weight="1"`
- Also reduced "New Game" button margin from 16dp to 8dp

## Test Results

### Player Cards Details
```
Card positions in HorizontalScrollView:
Card 1: [74,1499][294,1829]   (220x330 pixels)
Card 2: [310,1499][530,1829]  (220x330 pixels)
Card 3: [546,1499][766,1829]  (220x330 pixels)
Card 4: [782,1499][1002,1829] (220x330 pixels)
Card 5: [1018,1499][1036,1829] (18x330 pixels - partially visible, scrollable)

All cards within HorizontalScrollView bounds: [44,1379][1036,1950]
Scrolling enabled for cards that extend beyond viewport
```

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before Fix (Theoretical)
- Fixed height: 500dp â‰ˆ 1377 pixels @ 440dpi
- Player cards would start at: 1379
- Player cards would end at: 1379 + 1377 = 2756
- New Game button would start at: 2756 + 8 = 2764
- **Problem**: Button at 2764 exceeds screen height 2148
- **Overflow**: ~616 pixels below screen

### After Fix (Actual)
- Flexible height: 571 pixels (calculated from available space)
- Player cards: 1379 - 1950 âœ…
- New Game button: 1972 - 2104 âœ…
- **All content visible**: Maximum Y = 2104 < 2148
- **No overflow**: 44 pixels buffer remaining

## Performance
- App launch time: ~1.4 seconds
- No lag or stuttering observed
- Smooth scrolling in player cards area
- No memory warnings

## Logcat Output
- No errors related to layout
- No warnings about view clipping
- Standard Android system messages only
- Clean application startup

## Conclusion
**âœ… TEST PASSED - FIX VERIFIED**

The layout fix successfully resolves the phone layout issue:
1. All UI elements are now visible on phone screens
2. Player cards area properly sized using available space
3. New Game button fully visible at bottom
4. No content extends beyond screen boundaries
5. Layout adapts to device screen size automatically

## Recommendations
1. âœ… Deploy this fix in v2.3.13 release
2. âœ… Test on additional screen sizes if possible (smaller phones, larger phones)
3. âœ… Test in landscape orientation
4. âœ… Update CHANGELOG.md with this fix
5. âœ… Consider adding this to the wiki troubleshooting section
