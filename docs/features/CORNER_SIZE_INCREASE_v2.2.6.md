# Match Mania v2.2.6 - Larger Corner Elements

## Overview
Version 2.2.6 significantly increases the size of corner numbers and icons on cards, making them much more readable on phone screens.

## Problem Addressed

### Issue: Corner Elements Too Small on Phones

**Before v2.2.6**:
- Corner numbers: 16sp (small cards) / 24sp (large cards)
- Corner icons: 12px (small cards) / 20px (large cards)
- Hard to read on phone screens
- Required squinting to see card numbers
- Reduced playability and user experience

## Solution

### 1. Larger Corner Numbers

**Text Size Increase**:
```java
// Old sizes
cornerPaint.setTextSize(isSmall ? 16 : 24);  // Small cards: 16sp

// New sizes
cornerPaint.setTextSize(isSmall ? 22 : 28);  // Small cards: 22sp (+37%)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **37% larger** on small cards (phones)
- ✅ **17% larger** on large cards (top card)
- ✅ Much more readable at a glance
- ✅ Better accessibility
- ✅ Professional card game appearance

### 2. Larger Corner Icons

**Icon Size Increase**:
```java
// Old sizes
float cornerIconSize = isSmall ? 12 : 20;  // Small cards: 12px

// New sizes
float cornerIconSize = isSmall ? 18 : 24;  // Small cards: 18px (+50%)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **50% larger** on small cards
- ✅ **20% larger** on large cards
- ✅ Skip/Reverse/Draw Two icons much clearer
- ✅ Easier to identify card types
- ✅ Better visual hierarchy

### 3. Adjusted Padding

**Increased Edge Padding**:
```java
// Old padding
float edgePadding = Math.max(width * 0.08f, 12f);  // 8% or 12px

// New padding
float edgePadding = Math.max(width * 0.10f, 15f);  // 10% or 15px
```

**For icons**:
```java
// Old padding
float cornerPadding = Math.max(width * 0.10f, isSmall ? 20 : 30);

// New padding
float cornerPadding = Math.max(width * 0.12f, isSmall ? 24 : 32);
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ More breathing room for larger elements
- ✅ Still stays within card bounds
- ✅ Professional spacing
- ✅ Better visual balance

### 4. Improved Baseline Positioning

**Better Text Alignment**:
```java
// Adjusted vertical positioning for better centering
float topY = topPadding + cornerTextHeight * 0.75f;  // Top corner
float bottomY = height - topPadding + cornerTextHeight * 0.25f;  // Bottom corner
```

**Result**: Numbers appear better centered in their corner spaces.
