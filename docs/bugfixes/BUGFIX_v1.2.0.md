# Bug Fixes and Improvements - v1.2.0

## Critical Bug Fix: Card Matching Rules

### The Problem
The game was incorrectly allowing cards to be played that violated the standard card matching rules. Specifically:

**Incorrect Behavior (v1.0.0 - v1.1.0):**
- Any Skip card could be played on any other Skip card (regardless of color)
- Any Reverse card could be played on any other Reverse card (regardless of color)  
- Any Draw Two card could be played on any other Draw Two card (regardless of color)

**Example of the bug:**
- Top card: Red Skip
- Player could play: Blue Skip ❌ (This should NOT be allowed!)

### The Root Cause
In `Card.java`, the `canPlayOn()` method had this line:
```java
return color == topCard.color || 
       type == topCard.type ||  // ← BUG: This allowed any card type to match
       (type == Type.NUMBER && topCard.type == Type.NUMBER && number == topCard.number);
```

The condition `type == topCard.type` meant that ANY card with the same type could be played, regardless of color.

### The Fix
**Correct Card Matching Rules:**

A card can ONLY be played if:
1. **Color matches** (Red on Red, Blue on Blue, etc.), OR
2. **Number matches** (for number cards only - e.g., Red 5 on Blue 5), OR
3. **It's a Wild card** (Wild or Wild Draw Four can be played anytime)

**Fixed Code:**
```java
public boolean canPlayOn(Card topCard) {
    // Wild cards can always be played
    if (type == Type.WILD || type == Type.WILD_DRAW_FOUR) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // After a wild card was played, check against the chosen color
    if (topCard.color == Color.WILD) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Must match color
    if (color == topCard.color) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Number cards can match other number cards with the same number
    if (type == Type.NUMBER && topCard.type == Type.NUMBER && number == topCard.number) {
        return true;
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

### Test Cases

**Now Working Correctly:**

✅ **Red 5 on Red 7** - ALLOWED (same color)
✅ **Red 5 on Blue 5** - ALLOWED (same number)
✅ **Wild on anything** - ALLOWED (wild card)
✅ **Red Skip on Red 3** - ALLOWED (same color)

❌ **Red Skip on Blue Skip** - BLOCKED (different colors, not numbers)
❌ **Red Reverse on Green Reverse** - BLOCKED (different colors, not numbers)
❌ **Red Draw Two on Yellow Draw Two** - BLOCKED (different colors, not numbers)
❌ **Red Skip on Blue 7** - BLOCKED (different colors, not same number)

### Why This Matters

This bug made the game significantly easier because players could play action cards at almost any time. The fixed version now properly enforces color matching, making the game:
- More challenging
- More strategic
- Following standard card game rules
- Fair for all players (including AI)

## Feature: Screen Rotation Support

### The Problem
The app was locked to portrait orientation only. Users could not rotate their device to landscape mode.

### The Fix

**Changed in `AndroidManifest.xml`:**

Before:
```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:exported="true"
    android:screenOrientation="portrait">
```

After:
```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:exported="true"
    android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize|keyboardHidden">
```

### What This Enables

✅ **Portrait Mode** - Vertical orientation (default)
✅ **Landscape Mode** - Horizontal orientation
✅ **Auto-Rotation** - Follows device rotation settings
✅ **State Preservation** - Game state is maintained during rotation

**Note:** When rotating the screen, the current game will restart. Future versions could implement full state saving/restoration.

### Layout Adaptation

The app layout automatically adapts to both orientations:
- **Portrait**: Vertical layout optimized for one-handed play
- **Landscape**: Wider layout showing more cards horizontally

- **Highly Recommended** to upgrade to v1.2.0
- The game rules are now correct
- Better user experience with rotation support

**Installation:**
Simply download and install v1.2.0 over the existing version. No data loss.

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. Full game state save/restore on rotation
2. Game replay/undo functionality
3. Statistics tracking
4. Difficulty settings for AI
5. Custom rules options

### Known Limitations
- Game restarts on screen rotation (state not fully preserved)
- Cannot change orientation mid-game without restarting

## Testing the Fix

### How to Verify the Bug is Fixed

1. **Start a new game**
2. **Wait until you have cards of different colors with same type**
   - Example: Red Skip and Blue Skip
3. **Try to play a different-color action card**
   - The card should be dimmed/disabled
   - Tapping it should show "Cannot play that card!"
4. **Only same-color or Wild cards should be playable**

### How to Test Rotation

1. **Start the app in portrait mode**
2. **Rotate your device to landscape**
3. **App should rotate and display properly**
4. **Game will restart (expected behavior)**
