## 💡 Design Decisions

**Now:** User explicitly approves download

**Benefits:**
- Respects user bandwidth
- Respects user choice

**Previous:** Show dialog → User clicks → Opens package manager  
**Now:** Auto-opens package manager

**Benefits:**
- One less tap for user

- More like Play Store experience
- Reduces friction

### Why Three Buttons?

**Download:** Clear primary action  
**Skip:** Clear rejection for this version  
**Close:** Clear "maybe later" option

**Benefits:**
- No ambiguity
- Covers all user intentions
- Familiar pattern
- Easy to understand

---

**Positive:**
- ⬆️ User satisfaction (control over downloads)
