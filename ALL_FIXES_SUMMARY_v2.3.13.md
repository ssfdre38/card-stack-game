## Overview
Version 2.3.13 includes comprehensive improvements to screen layout support, fixing critical issues and adding full rotation support for enhanced player flexibility.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Phone Portrait Layout Fix (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Player cards and New Game button were below screen on phones

**Impact:**
- Before: Content 578px below screen
- After: All content visible with 176px buffer

### 2. ✅ Landscape Orientation Support (NEW FEATURE)
**Problem:** No dedicated landscape layout (user requested full rotation support)
**Solution:** Created optimized landscape layout with side-by-side design
**File:** `app/src/main/res/layout-land/activity_main.xml` (NEW)

**Layout Design:**
- Left 40%: Game controls and information
