# Draw to Match Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a new "Draw to Match" custom rule for Match Mania v2.1.0. This feature allows players to enable a rule where they must keep drawing cards until they get a playable card, rather than drawing just one card and ending their turn.

## What Was Done

### 1. Updated GameSettings.java
- Added `KEY_DRAW_TO_MATCH` constant for SharedPreferences
- Added `DEFAULT_DRAW_TO_MATCH = false` default value
- Implemented `isDrawToMatchEnabled()` getter method
- Implemented `setDrawToMatchEnabled(boolean)` setter method

### 2. Updated SettingsActivity.java
- Added `drawToMatchSwitch` Switch variable
- Connected switch to layout in `initializeViews()`
- Load switch state from settings in `loadSettings()`
- Save switch state in `saveSettings()`

### 3. Updated activity_settings.xml
- Added new LinearLayout section for Draw to Match toggle
- Included title "Draw to Match"
- Added description: "Keep drawing until you get a playable card"
- Added Switch with ID `drawToMatchSwitch`
- Positioned before the buttons section with proper divider

### 4. Updated MainActivity.java
#### Player Draw Logic (drawButton.setOnClickListener)
- Added conditional check for `settings.isDrawToMatchEnabled()`
- **When enabled**: Loop drawing cards until a playable card is found (max 20 cards)
- **When disabled**: Standard behavior (draw 1 card)
- Display appropriate toast messages showing number of cards drawn

#### AI Draw Logic (processAITurns)
- Added conditional check for `settings.isDrawToMatchEnabled()` in AI turn processing
- **When enabled**: AI keeps drawing until it gets a playable card (max 20 cards)
- **When disabled**: Standard AI behavior (draw 1 card)
- Display toast showing number of cards drawn by AI

### 5. Version Update
- Updated `app/build.gradle`
- Version Code: 7 → 8
- Version Name: "2.0.2" → "2.1.0"

### 6. Build and Release
- Successfully built both debug and release APKs
- Created release notes in `RELEASE_v2.1.0_NOTES.md`
- Committed all changes with descriptive commit message
- Pushed to GitHub repository
- Created GitHub release v2.1.0 with both APK files attached
