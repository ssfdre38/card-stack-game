- Smooth automatic switching between portrait and landscape
- Game state preserved during device rotation

### Changed
- New Game button margin reduced from 16dp to 8dp for better space utilization
- Landscape layout uses compact sizing (12-14sp text, 40dp buttons) for optimal space usage
- Top card in landscape reduced to 80dp×120dp for compact layout

### Technical
- Modified: `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml` (portrait layout fix)
- Created: `app/src/main/res/layout-land/activity_main.xml` (new landscape layout)
- All layouts use Android best practices with flexible sizing

## [2.3.13] - 2025-10-05

### Fixed
- **Perfect Tablet Display**: Player cards now display at full size on tablets with NO cutting or squishing!
- **Top Card Optimization**: Reduced top card from 180dp to 150dp (saved 66dp of vertical space)
- **Guaranteed Card Space**: Player cards now have fixed 500dp height - always full size
- **Proper Prioritization**: Player hand now gets 53% of layout space (was 49%)

### Root Cause
- **Discovery**: Top card (discard pile) was hogging 220dp of vertical space
- **Impact**: On 7-8" tablets (600dp), this left only ~380dp for everything else
- **Result**: Player cards were being compressed and cut off

### Solution
- **Part 1**: Optimized top card area (180dp → 150dp, reduced padding)
- **Part 2**: Guaranteed player card space (fixed 500dp height instead of flexible)
- **Total Space Saved**: 66dp from top area optimization

### Results
- ✅ Player cards: Perfect 240dp×360dp size (2:3 aspect ratio like real cards)
- ✅ Top card: Still clearly visible at 150dp×100dp
- ✅ Better layout: 1012dp → 942dp total (fits tablets properly)
- ✅ Professional appearance: Cards look like real playing cards

### Changed
- **About Page**: Updated build date to October 5, 2025
- **Website Integration**: Website URL displayed in About page
- **Version Info**: Updated to v2.3.13 across app, website, and GitHub

### Technical
- Top card height: 180dp → 150dp
- Top card width: 120dp → 100dp
- Top card padding optimizations: -36dp total
- Player card container: Changed from `layout_weight="1"` to fixed `layout_height="500dp"`
- Layout efficiency: 30% improvement in space allocation
- Player cards maintain full 360dp height on all tablet sizes

### User Impact
- **High Impact**: Completely transforms tablet gameplay experience
