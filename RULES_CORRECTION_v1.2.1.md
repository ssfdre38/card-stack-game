# Rules Correction - v1.2.1

## Important: Rule Clarification

### What Changed from v1.2.0 to v1.2.1

In v1.2.0, I over-corrected the card matching rules. The correct rules for standard card games like this are:

## ✅ CORRECT CARD MATCHING RULES (v1.2.1)

A card CAN be played if ANY of these conditions are met:

### 1. Color Match
- Any card matching the color of the top card
- Example: Red 5 on Red 7 ✅

### 2. Number Match (Number Cards Only)
- Number cards can match other number cards with the same number, regardless of color
- Example: Red 5 on Blue 5 ✅

### 3. Action Card Type Match
- **Skip on Skip** (any color) ✅
- **Reverse on Reverse** (any color) ✅  
- **Draw Two on Draw Two** (any color) ✅
- This allows strategic play and card stacking

### 4. Wild Cards
- Wild and Wild Draw Four can be played on ANY card ✅

## Examples of Valid Plays

✅ **Red 5** on **Red 7** - Same color
✅ **Red 5** on **Blue 5** - Same number
✅ **Red Skip** on **Red 3** - Same color
✅ **Red Skip** on **Blue Skip** - Same action type (Skip on Skip)
✅ **Blue Reverse** on **Green Reverse** - Same action type (Reverse on Reverse)
✅ **Yellow Draw Two** on **Red Draw Two** - Same action type (Draw Two on Draw Two)
✅ **Wild** on **anything** - Wild card
✅ **Wild Draw Four** on **anything** - Wild card

## Examples of Invalid Plays

❌ **Red Skip** on **Blue 7** - Different color, different type
❌ **Green Reverse** on **Yellow 3** - Different color, different type
❌ **Blue 3** on **Red 5** - Different color, different number
❌ **Red Draw Two** on **Blue Reverse** - Different color, different action types

## Why Action Cards Can Match by Type

In standard card game mechanics:
- **Strategic Depth**: Allows players to chain action cards for more interesting gameplay
- **Standard Practice**: This is how most card games work
- **Balance**: Prevents action cards from being too hard to play
- **Fun Factor**: Creates exciting moments when multiple action cards are played in succession

## Implementation

The `canPlayOn()` method now checks:

```java
public boolean canPlayOn(Card topCard) {
    // 1. Wild cards can always be played
    if (type == Type.WILD || type == Type.WILD_DRAW_FOUR) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // 2. Match against chosen color after wild
    if (topCard.color == Color.WILD) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // 3. Colors match
    if (color == topCard.color) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // 4. Action types match (Skip on Skip, Reverse on Reverse, Draw Two on Draw Two)
    if (type == topCard.type && type != Type.NUMBER) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // 5. Number cards match by number
    if (type == Type.NUMBER && topCard.type == Type.NUMBER && number == topCard.number) {
        return true;
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

## Comparison: v1.2.0 vs v1.2.1

### v1.2.0 (Too Restrictive)
❌ Red Skip on Blue Skip - BLOCKED
❌ Action cards only worked on same color
❌ Game was harder than intended

### v1.2.1 (Correct)
✅ Red Skip on Blue Skip - ALLOWED
✅ Action cards can match by type OR color
✅ Game follows standard card game mechanics

## Strategic Implications

With correct rules:
- **Card Stacking**: Multiple Draw Twos can be stacked
- **Action Chains**: Skip → Skip → Skip creates interesting gameplay
- **More Options**: Players have more valid moves
- **Better Flow**: Game is more dynamic and fun

## Summary

**v1.2.0 was too restrictive.** It required action cards to ONLY match by color, which is not how standard card games work.

**v1.2.1 corrects this** to allow:
- Color matching (all cards)
- Type matching (action cards)
- Number matching (number cards)
- Wild cards (always playable)

This creates the proper balance of strategy, challenge, and fun!
