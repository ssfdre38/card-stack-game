# Match Mania v2.1.0 - Draw to Match Rule

## Release Date
October 4, 2024

## New Features

### Draw to Match Custom Rule
Added a new custom rule option in the Settings menu that changes how drawing cards works:

- **Standard Rule (Default)**: When you can't play, you draw one card and your turn ends
- **Draw to Match Rule (New)**: When you can't play, you must keep drawing cards until you get a playable card (matching color, number, or special card)

This rule makes the game more dynamic and can lead to dramatic changes in hand sizes, adding an exciting new dimension to gameplay strategy.

## How to Enable

1. Open the app and tap the Settings button
2. Scroll down to find the "Draw to Match" toggle
3. Enable the switch to activate this rule
4. Save settings and start a new game

## Implementation Details
